## Done

I want to view a list of only the names of the foods I have logged.

## To Do

I want to be able to click on a name to view the details and calories for that food.
I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with its name, calories and details.
I want to view either all foods, only unhealthy foods that are more than 300 calories, or only healthy foods that are less than 300 calories.
I want to be able to click on a food and then edit its name, details or calories in case I decide to pretend my fries were only 100 calories instead of 365 calories.

## Backlog

Add some unique/creative styling.
Display of the total number of calories consumed that day.
Display the average number of calories consumed as well as the total.
Add a property to the food record so that the app keeps track of when each food was eaten. You could either have the user enter a time and/or date, or the app could automatically check the time when a new food is submitted.
Expand the app to show multiple days of foods consumed. Use some styling to group the food entries by day. Then include a component to display the total calories for whichever day the user suggests.
Add a new master component to average the total calories consumed per day so that the user can figure out how much exercise they should be getting on a regular basis.
